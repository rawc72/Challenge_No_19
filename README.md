# 19 Progressive Web Applications (PWA): Budget Tracker
PWA's are web applications that use service-workers, manifests, and other web-platform features, combined with progressive enhancement. In this exercise, I will use PWA to create an application which gives users a fast and easy way to track their money, but allowing them to access that information at any time, including offline functionality.

## User Story
As an avid traveller, I want to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection so that my account balance is accurate when I am traveling.

## User Experience
Given a Budget Tracker without an internet connection, when the user inputs an expense or deposit, then they will receive a notification that they have added an expense or deposit. When the user reestablishes an internet connection, then the deposits or expenses added while they were offline is added to their transaction history and their totals are updated.
